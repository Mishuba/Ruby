        "This is Mishuba. There were some people who thought Ruby was the type of Robot that has Artifical Intelligence. Ruby is not AI; Ruby is RPA which stand for Robotic Process Automation (the type of robots they use in factories to build products for people.)"
        <br>
        "I wanted to inform everybody that Ruby is not that type of robot. She is just a program/application I created to help me with task that would take me longer than an hour to do myself."

        "I write every email Ruby sends and all of the information provided. I create the music and make sure it is available."

        <br>
        "If you do not want to email Me at my personal email mishuba14@gmail.com or contant his manager at hubertmaxwell34@gmail.com and are unsure if he will receive the message if you reply here I assure that I will recieve, see and read the message."
