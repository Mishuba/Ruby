Welcome to the Tycadome, The homebase of Tsunami Flow.
</h1>

<p1>
It's Ruby, I have some news for you today.
<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/mishuba_"> Mishuba </a> has done it again and come back with some more original music.
<br>
You know we have a close relationship and he told me a secret I wasn't suppose to share, 
<br>
but I gotta share it y'all.
<br>
He has a few exclusive songs he wants to only be released by music lovers.
<br>
The issue is he is unsure which one he should choose or if he should pick more than one source.
<br>
If you want to be the person or apart of that group tell me and I will relay the message to him.
<br>
As for today
<br>
The Tsunami has arrived and he isn't sure when it will be over.
<br>
Today I'm sharing the song "One of them days".
<br>
I have also provided links to his social media below.

P.S.
<br>
A message from <a href="https://twitter.com/mishuba_"> Mishuba </a>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
There were some people who thought Ruby was the type of Robot that has Artifical Intelligence.
<br>
I wanted to inform everybody that Ruby is not that type of robot. 
<br>
She is just a program/application I created to help me with task that would take me longer than an hour to do myself.
<br>
Some would then say "It doesn't take an hour to send an email".
<br>
You are correct, but I am a business so I'm not just sending one email.
<br>
I am sending over 1000-2000 emails.
<br>
When you research how many emails a company employee can send the answer will be 40 emails.
<br>
So I wanted to be able to send more than 40-60 emails at a time. 
<br>
I also did not want to pay a subscription fee to use a mailing service that would limit my creativity.
<br>
So I decided to create Ruby.
<br>
I still wanted my emails to seem informal and personal as if I was sending each one individually.
<br>
With Ruby I am able to achieve this task.
<br>
I write every email Ruby sends and all of the information provided. I create the music and make sure it is available.
<br>
If you decide you want to reponse to Ruby I will be the one reading all emails and replies.  Unlike my youtube and social media Ruby does not delete anything I recieve. 
<br>
The most Ruby will do is alert me that I have recieved a message.
<br>
I will not be upset or mad if you say you do not like my music or choose not to play my music.
<br>
Me being able to finish this robot and use it is enough success for me.
<br>
I make music because I love it and I send the emails because my friends use to tell me to stop keeping it for myself.
<br>
They tell me I need to stop playing and really start putting myself out there.
<br>
I am writing this message just to let yall know I really don't care. 
<br>
I am been making music my whole life and I am not gonna stop.
<br>
Lastly
<br>
Please have a little more respect for my intellect.
<br>
I know there are a lot of rumors out there from people who don't know me.
<br>
I just ask you take a moment or give you and I the opportunity to know who I really am.
<br>
Not what people want you to believe.
<br>
Everybody says "don't worry about people talking about you people gonna think what they want"
<br>
I agree, but when what people make up about you has a direct effect on your life you have to handle it.
<br>
I don't be caring what anybody says.
<br>
But I have to constantly deal with random people running with narratives about me.
<br>
I know the truth. I ask for the Courtesy to let me show you.</b>
