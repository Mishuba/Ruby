"P.S." 
"This is Mishuba. There were some people who thought Ruby was the type of Robot that has Artifical Intelligence.
<br>
I wanted to inform everybody that Ruby is not that type of robot. She is just a program/application I created to help me with task that would take me longer than an hour to do myself.
<br>
I write every email Ruby sends and all of the information provided. I create the music and make sure it is available.
<br>
If you decide you want to reponse to Ruby I will be the one reading all emails and replies.  Unlike my youtube and social media Ruby does not delete anything I recieve. 
<br>
The most Ruby will do is alert me that I have recieved a message.
<br>
If you do not want to email Me at my personal email mishuba14@gmail.com or contant his manager at hubertmaxwell34@gmail.com and are unsure if he will receive the message if you reply here I assure that I will recieve, see and read the message.
<br>
<br>
"Good bye, until we meet again."
