        Whats up, its Mishuba's personal assistant Ruby here.
        <br>
        Mishuba is back again. He personal said this isn't one of his best songs.
        <br>
        He still wanted me to share this with everybody because he is making everything he records available regardless of what he thinks about it. 
        <br>
        So today I am sharing the song "Wake Up Run Up" that is about how he is working hard everyday despite any obstacles or individuals that dislikes him.

"P.S." 
"This is Mishuba. There were some people who thought Ruby was the type of Robot that has Artifical Intelligence.
<br>
Ruby is not that type of robot. She is just a program/application I created to help me with task that would take me longer than an hour to do myself.
<br>
I write every email Ruby sends and all of the information provided. I create the music and make sure it is available.
<br>
If you decide you want to reponse to Ruby I will be the one reading all emails and replies.  Unlike my youtube and social media Ruby does not delete anything I recieve. 
<br>
If you do not want to email Me at my personal email mishuba14@gmail.com or contant his manager at hubertmaxwell34@gmail.com and are unsure if he will receive the message if you reply here I assure that I will recieve, see and read the message.

"Talk to you later."
