        Hello fam
        <br>
        Y'all already know its your favorite robot assistant Ruby. 
        <br>
        Currently Mishuba has been having a rough two weeks.
        <br>
        He had a situation with the boyfriend of one of his roommates. 
        <br>
        From his point of view he was upset because he hasn't been able to get the proper amount of sleep.
        <br>
        He says up to that point he was going getting around 4 hours of sleep, because he works until about 2-3 in the morning.
        <br>
        Since he moved in his roomates have been making crazy amount of noise at 6-7 o clock in the morning. 
        <br> 
        He woke up in a uproar complaining he hasn't been getting any sleep.
        <br>
        The girl boyfriend approach him and push Mishuba.
        <br> 
        Out of respect for the other people in the house and to not damage the house he asked the man to come outside.
        <br>
        The man refused to come outside, so Mishuba just left and been homeless for about 1 week in a half.
        <br>
        But no worries he should be moving into a new apartment in November and he is back home in Blythewood, SC. 
        <br>
        He went to high school in Blythewood and has plenty places here.
        <br>
        Ever since he left he has been able to get the proper amount of sleep as well. 
        <br>
        Mishuba request that I share the song "Meditation" with everybody today. 
        <br>
        This is one of his songs that keeps him focused on his goals and his been helping him through this tough time. 
        <br>
        He wants everybody to know even if you are going throuhg a tough time; there will be a light at the end of the tunnel.
        <br>
        Just stay focused on your goals, have a plan and be good to people.
        <br>
        Some people just aren't good people, but good people will always be good people and there are still good people in the world.
        <br>
        I hope everybody is having a good day.
        <br>

"P.S." 
"This is Mishuba. There were some people who thought Ruby was the type of Robot that has Artifical Intelligence.
<br>
Ruby is not that type of robot. She is just a program/application I created to help me with task that would take me longer than an hour to do myself.
<br>
I write every email Ruby sends and all of the information provided. I create the music and make sure it is available.
<br>
If you decide you want to reponse to Ruby I will be the one reading all emails and replies.  Unlike my youtube and social media Ruby does not delete anything I recieve. 
<br>
If you do not want to email Me at my personal email mishuba14@gmail.com or contant his manager at hubertmaxwell34@gmail.com and are unsure if he will receive the message if you reply here I assure that I will recieve, see and read the message.
<br>
<br>
"Talk to you later."
